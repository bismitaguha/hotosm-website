The power of volunteer mapping is shown when disaster-affected areas can be mapped in a few days. When thousands of volunteers join together quickly, areas affected by a disaster then have the necessary data for a robust humanitarian response. Through our [Missing Maps](https://www.missingmaps.org/) work, we continue to focus on preparedness mapping for unmapped areas but a challenge still exists to map at a scale and quality for humanitarian use. Around the world, there are still hundreds of millions of buildings and millions of kilometers of road missing from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), and the data quality for humanitarians must be higher. To meet the challenge of mapping the unmapped areas, the Tasking Manager requires two key improvements to the workflow: an increase in data quality of edits being made, and an increase in mapping and validating efficiency. 

Building upon the work the HOT community started in the fall of 2018, HOT is working with Microsoft's [AI for Humanitarian Action](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-humanitarian-action) program to address these challenges by building enhanced assisted mapping workflows with machine learning into the Tasking Manager and create an open building dataset in Uganda and Tanzania.

There are promising potentials for machine/deep/statistical learning assisted mapping. Especially when it comes to image processing the achievements are tangible. HOT will pilot the use of this machine leveraged power of the newly available programming models to improve data quality and mapping experience. In this project, a well-designed use case around the Tasking Manager is to be implemented, which is focusing on machine learning assisted project creation and task facilitation.

We are teaming up with Microsoft, in order to provide an Open Source solution to include any kind of machine learning models into the Tasking Manager and other applications around OpenStreetMap. In addition through the project, Microsoft will be creating open building datasets for Uganda and Tanzania. These building datasets will be made available with an open license and used during the piloting of the new Tasking Manager workflows. 

All this new work is thanks in part to the American Red Cross and the work theyâ€™ve done with Microsoft through the Missing Maps project with Microsoft. American Red Cross is a key partner in the project and will be helping work with us as we implement the work on the Tasking Manager.
