## About HOT
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a US-based NGO and global community of thousands of volunteers working together to use maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. As the world’s preeminent participatory mapping NGO, HOT has fostered a global mapping community composed of more than 130,000 people with ground operations in five countries. When major disaster strikes anywhere in the world, HOT rallies this global network to create the maps and data that enable responders to reach those in need.

HOT has collaborated with the World Bank in Tanzania since 2015 as implementing partner for the community mapping component of the Ramani Huria (“Open Map” in English) program. During this time, HOT has trained nearly 500 young people in open geospatial data and participatory mapping methods through a partnership including Ardhi University and the Tanzania Red Cross Society. Starting in September 2017, HOT has partnered with IREX on the Data Zetu project. Data Zetu aims to empower communities to make better, more evidence-based decisions to improve their lives. Through partnerships and collaborations with local communities, Data Zetu works with stakeholders to build skills and develop digital and offline tools that make information accessible to everyone.
