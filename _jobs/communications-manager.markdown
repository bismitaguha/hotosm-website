**About HOT**
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a Washington, D.C. -based NGO and global community of thousands of volunteers working together to use maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. As the world’s preeminent participatory mapping NGO, HOT has fostered a global mapping community composed of more than 100,000 people with ground operations in five countries. When major disaster strikes anywhere in the world, HOT rallies this global network to create the maps and data that enable responders to reach those in need, serving humanitarian partners such as UNHCR, American Red Cross, and MSF.

### About the Position

The Communications Manager is a newly created position that will work closely with HOT’s Partnerships Manager, Operations Manager, Executive Director, and field office Communications Specialists to plan and coordinate all of HOT’s external communications.

HOT’s diverse audiences, communications channels, and geographic reach require a cohesive strategy to convey impact. This role will involve increasing the standard and reach of all HOT communications across all methods; social media, television, radio/podcast, media coverage & press releases.
