**Contract length: 9 months**  
**Reports to: Director, Technology Innovation**  

Free, up-to-date maps are a critical resource when relief organizations are responding to disasters or political crises. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) creates and provides those maps. When major disaster strikes anywhere in the world, HOT rallies a huge network of volunteers to create open data, online in OpenStreetMap, the maps that enable responders to reach those in need.

To conduct this work HOT builds and maintains over ten open source mapping tools. We work with volunteers and contributors to design and develop these products to serve the larger HOT and OpenStreetMap community. HOT is hiring a Technical Project Manager to oversee product development of one of these open source tools: Tasking Manager. The Tasking Manager is one of HOT's flagship tools to help coordinate mapping in OpenStreetMap. This spring HOT and the Tasking Manager partners will be redeveloping many features of the tool, including integrating machine learning outputs into a mapping workflow.

The Technical Project Manager will have two primary roles with a focus on the Tasking Manager. First is as a product manager. As a product manager, you will develop a product roadmap, engage volunteers, facilitate developer meetings, and provide development coordination. This is an exciting role to lead the direction and development of HOT’s core mapping coordination tool. Second is as a project manager providing financial and administrative oversight of grant funding and coordinate specific grant-funded activities. In a project manager role, you will work directly with HOT’s partners and funders to implement the grants and help ensure the project runs on time and within budget. 

This position will be based remotely with potential travel to HOT’s offices or other locations for meetings. Working schedule is approximately half-time at 4 hours per day, 5 days a week.
