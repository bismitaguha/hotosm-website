## About HOT
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a US-based NGO and global community of thousands of volunteers working together to use maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. As the world’s preeminent participatory mapping NGO, HOT has fostered a global mapping community composed of more than 150,000 people with ground operations in eight countries. During crisis, HOT rallies this global network to create the maps and data that enable responders to reach those in need.

## Project Overview
The “Crowdsourcing Non-Camp Refugee Data Through OpenStreetMap (OSM)” is a UNHCR-HOT partnership project, which aims to improve program planning and service delivery to refugee communities, develop better integration with host communities, and build refugee self-reliance through Open-Source Map Data. The program trains and equips community leaders in refugee communities to map vulnerabilities and assets in the places they live, filling in key data gaps and “blank spots” on the map. These micro-level maps are created using techniques including crowdsourced data collection on mobile phones and the global community mapping efforts of the 45,000-strong Humanitarian OpenStreetMap community. The resulting multilanguage maps and map data are then made openly available online in OSM, on mobile phones for navigation, in printed form in refugee social/community centers, and provided to local stakeholders and response coordination.

## Position Overview
The Information Management Associate will report directly to HOT’s Country Manager in Uganda, helping coordinate field operations and outputs with legible and informative GIS outputs/production. The individual will ensure that data is up to date, correctly cleaned, managed, archived, uploaded and attributed. Data accessibility will comprise a key responsibility of the post, and a meticulous but imaginitive approach will be key. The post-holder will work to facilitate the creation of comprehensive, highly detailed maps for HOT Uganda, with incisive and revealing field-narratives in mind. These will include refugee-specific base maps for disaster risk analysis, operations and monitoring by partners, contributing to more effective advocacy, navigation, and service delivery by humanitarian actors.

This individual will co-advocate with multiple partner organisations and UN bodies working with data and risk information in Uganda, and promote access to - and use of - OpenStreetMap data by all stakeholders. S/he may also serve in a monitoring and evaluation capacity, ensuring that outputs and outcomes of project activities are appropriately captured for accurate, nuanced reporting to donors. The position will involve management and manipulations of data across platforms, and reciprocations between Open and proprietary data formats. 

There will be a need for skilled organisation of personnel, workflows and data, and understanding of the architectures of both traditional NGOs and more multi-lateral tech methodologies. Candidates considered for this post will be able to show a capacity for an improvised yet orderly approach, involving the design of data management systems which are scalable, yet accommodate constraints dictated by resource-poor settings. This is a dynamic evolutionary post, located in an era which increasingly acknowledges Open Source Ethos as a contributing standard in the future of international disaster relief.
