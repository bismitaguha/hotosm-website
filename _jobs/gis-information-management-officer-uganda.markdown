### General Information

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a U.S.- based NGO that applies the principles of open data sharing for humanitarian response and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Free, up-to-date maps are a critical resource when relief organizations are responding to natural and man-made disasters, and political crises. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) creates and provides those maps.

* **Contract Duration:** 2 months, with probable extension

### Position Overview:

This role demands understanding of the impact of data upon modern humanitarian disaster response, and a nuanced grasp of rural communities in resource-poor settings. The ideal candidate will be able to have an empathic yet orderly approach to the design of ‘hyper-local’ data collection, a careful attitude to the management and distribution of data, and a desire to communicate highly detailed map products - both through advocacy and through the creation of clearly composed visual outputs. 

The GIS Information Management Officer (GIMO) will oversee, manage and implement meticulous and structured field data collection, uploads to OpenStreetMap, and the processing of confidential or non-public humanitarian data. The GIMO will ensure that data is up-to-date, well-defined, and correctly attributed. S/he will cooperate with multiple partner organisations working with data around refugees in Uganda, and promote access to and use of OpenStreetMap data by all stakeholders. S/he may also serve in a monitoring and evaluation capacity, ensuring that outputs and outcomes of project activities are appropriately captured and reported. The GIMO reports directly to HOT’s Country Manager in Uganda, working in close coordination with Operations and Mapping Supervisors.

### Responsibilities

* Participate in information management working group meetings representing the organisation, and provide the necessary support in presenting the relevant GIS data and information.

* Provide advice and counsel concerning information management issues and industry trend to the partners.

### The ideal candidate will have:
**Preferable:**
* Strong deadline-oriented organisational skills, a commitment to deliver, and a track-record of time-critical project management delivery.

* A demonstrable and adaptive understanding of the principles underlying OpenStreetMap.

* Collaborative managerial approach, and team ethos.

* Bachelor's degree or equivalent in a relevant field, or track record of commercial project management in a fast-moving results-orientated environment.

### HOT Uganda - Further Information:

Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team is an implementing partner of UNHCR, situated in a strategic position central to the coordination of the Combined Refugee Response in Uganda. HOT aims to improve program planning and service delivery to refugee communities, develop better integration with host communities, and build refugee self-reliance through through sustained ‘citizen interaction’ with Open Map Data.

Our programs train and equip members of refugee communities to map their own vulnerabilities and assets in the places they live, filling in key data gaps and “blank spots” on the map. These micro-level maps are created using techniques including crowd-sourced data collection on mobile phones and the global community mapping efforts of the 65,000-strong Humanitarian OpenStreetMap community. The resulting multi-language maps and map data are then made openly available on-line in OSM, on mobile phones for navigation, in printed form in refugee social/community centers, and are being integrated with stakeholder/government information systems at local and national levels.
