**About HOT**

Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a Washington, D.C. based NGO and global community of thousands of volunteers working together to use maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. As the world’s preeminent participatory mapping NGO, HOT has fostered a global mapping community composed of more than 100,000 people with ground operations in five countries.
