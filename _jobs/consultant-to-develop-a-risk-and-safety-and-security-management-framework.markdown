## About HOT

Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a US-based NGO and global community of thousands of volunteers working together to use maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. As the world’s preeminent participatory mapping NGO, HOT has fostered a global mapping community composed of more than 50,000 people with ground operations in five countries. When major disaster strikes anywhere in the world, HOT rallies this global network to create the maps and data that enable responders to reach those in need.

## About the Position

As HOT grows, the diverse set of mapping, training, data collection, and technology innovation projects in our portfolio have increasingly varying ways of contributing to our overall impact. Each project carries out important activities, but we currently lack a consolidated approach to safety and security planning across these projects. This also covers an assessment of risk to the organization itself, country offices (3-4 countries), and a selected set of individual projects.

The consultant will work closely with HOT’s Executive Director, Board of Directors, and Senior Management team to assess, identify and manage risk factors in our current projects and programming, develop processes and policy for safety assurance and mitigation, and promotion of safety and security. The emphasis is on a) physical risks on operations in our field projects in countries such as Liberia, Tanzania, Uganda, Indonesia, Botswana, Zambia and Turkey, and b) (resulting) financial, programmatic and institutional risks to the organization as a whole. Risk factors include, for example, political, traffic, disease, crime, and conflict.

The consultant will work remotely and may travel to office locations in the US, Africa, and Asia.

## Expected Deliverables

1. Identification of specific areas of risk, recommendations for mitigation of these risks, and creating recommendations for the strengthening and improvement of HOT’s overall safety and security planning.

2. Assist country offices in implementing safety assurance and promotion, and effective communication and implementation of safety planning.

## Expected deliverables include:

1. A risk analysis/assessment at various levels of the organization (global, country level, and project level), including hazard identification, exposure, potential mitigation measures and procedures, and recommendations and guidelines on risk management.
