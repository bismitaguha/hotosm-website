**General Information**
The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) in Uganda plays a central part in the UNHCR’s coordination of the refugee response, and also engages with projects around OSM citizen mapping for disaster risk reduction in Urban and rural environment development. As an international NGO, HOT applies the principles of open data sharing for humanitarian response and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Free, up-to-date maps are a critical resource when relief organizations are responding to disasters or political crises. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) creates and provides those maps.

**Positions:** 2

**Contract duration:** 3 months (July - September)

**Reports to:** Country Manager

**Starting date:** July 2018

**Project Overview**
The HOT agenda in Uganda aims to improve programme planning and service delivery to refugee communities, develop better integration with host communities, and build refugee self-reliance through open map data. The programme trains and equips NGOs and local volunteers within refugee communities to map vulnerabilities and assets in the places they live, filling in key data-gaps and “blank spots” on the map. These micro-level maps are created using techniques including crowd-sourced data collection on mobile phones and the remote mapping efforts of the global Humanitarian OpenStreetMap community. The resulting multi-language maps and map data are then made openly available online in OSM, on mobile phones for navigation, in printed form in refugee social/community centers, and are being integrated with stakeholder/government information systems at local and national levels.
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team is an implementing partner of UNHCR, strategically positioned in the coordination of the Combined Refugee Response in Uganda. HOT aims to improve programme planning and service delivery to refugee communities, develop better integration with host communities, and build refugee self-reliance through sustained ‘citizen interaction’ with Open Map Data.
