### General Information

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a U.S.- based NGO that applies the principles of open data sharing for humanitarian response and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

* **Number of Positions:** 1

* **Contract duration:** 6 months, Part-time 4 days per week initially, with possible expansion to 5 days

* **Reports to:** Country Manager

* **Starting date:** July 2018

### Project Overview

Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team is an implementing partner of UNHCR, situated in a strategic position central to the coordination of the Combined Refugee Response in Uganda. HOT aims to improve program planning and service delivery to refugee communities, develop better integration with host communities, and build refugee self-reliance through through sustained ‘citizen interaction’ with Open Map Data.
Our programs train and equip members of refugee communities to map their own vulnerabilities and assets in the places they live, filling in key data gaps and “blank spots” on the map. These micro-level maps are created using techniques including crowdsourced data collection on mobile phones and the global community mapping efforts of the 65,000-strong Humanitarian OpenStreetMap community. The resulting multilanguage maps and map data are then made openly available online in OSM, on mobile phones for navigation, in printed form in refugee social/community centers, and are being integrated with stakeholder/government information systems at local and national levels.
HOT also supports and implements Disaster Risk Management programs in Urban settings, and maintains a wide network of partners. HOT trainings  in 'OpenGIS'  also take place within these NGO and Government Agencies, and this methodology is becoming increasingly central to the coordinated refugee response and institutional development plans.
