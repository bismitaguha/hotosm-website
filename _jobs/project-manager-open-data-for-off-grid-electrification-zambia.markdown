Contract duration: Fixed-term 4 month contract (full-time) with possible extension for an additional 2 months

Reports to: Director, HOT Community Programs

## About HOT
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a US-based NGO and global community of thousands of volunteers working together to use maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. As the world’s preeminent participatory mapping NGO, HOT has fostered a global mapping community composed of more than 50,000 people with ground operations in five countries. When major disaster strikes anywhere in the world, HOT rallies this global network to create the maps and data that enable responders to reach those in need.

HOT is soliciting CVs for an IFC-funded project aimed at using open geospatial data to characterize and prioritize villages for placement of mini-grid energy solutions in Zambia.

## About the Position
In Zambia, the overall national electricity access rate is 31 percent. Approximately 47 percent of the population in urban and peri-urban areas, and only 4 percent in rural areas, have access to electricity. It is important to identify the most appropriate electrification options to provide energy to those rural areas. For many sites that could mean off-grid electrification primarily using mini-grid technologies. To select the best locations for off-grid electrification a detailed understanding of the current situation of the socio-economic structures and demands of rural areas is necessary.

The Project Manager will direct this effort, reporting to HOT’s Director of Community Programs, and is responsible for the implementation of all HOT participatory mapping programming in Zambia. This position is based full-time in Lusaka, Zambia. It includes managing the establishment of HOT’s local presence in Zambia, overseeing the work of a small local team, the development of mapping activities by groups of local volunteers and providing guidance on technical aspects of the project including GIS and OpenStreetMap.
